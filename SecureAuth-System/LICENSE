Additional Information:

This software implements a distributed password security system using chaotic 
hash functions. The algorithm distributes password verification across multiple 
virtual servers to enhance security through:

1. Chaotic Random Number Generation (ChaoticRNG)
2. Multi-server hash fragment distribution
3. Advanced cryptographic mixing techniques

For security-critical applications, users should:
- Conduct independent security audits
- Implement additional security measures as needed
- Follow current cryptographic best practices
- Consider regulatory compliance requirements

The authors make no claims about the cryptographic strength or suitability
for any particular security application. Users assume full responsibility
for evaluating the appropriateness of this software for their use case.
